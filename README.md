This is a collection of custom themes for Misskey (as well as its forks, such as Sharkey) created by the [hol.ogra.ph](https://hol.ogra.ph) community. 

## How to Use

On Misskey (and its forks), with a simple client-side JSON configuration, you can change the colors, fonts, etc of your interface. 

Simply navigate to `Settings` -> `Themes` -> `Install a Theme` while logged into your Misskey instance. Then, copy and paste the contents of the desired theme file into the provided text box. Then click "Install". That's it! 

If you want to preview a theme before committing to installing it, you can instead go to the `Make a Theme` section and paste the theme contents there. This way, you can clear/reset the theme back to normal with a simple browser refresh. 

## Theme List

### Holo-Yang (Dark)

Currently the default Holograph theme. Vaporwave vibes, with an emphasis on fuchsia. 

### Holo-Yin (Dark)

Alternate version of the default Holo-Yang holograph theme. Swaps cyan and fuchsia, for a different feel. 

### Holo Girl Summer 

WIP - my first attempt at a light theme. Pastel blues and yellows. 

### Holoween 

WIP - a mysterious orange and teal theme, ideal for a witchy feel or just for night time browsing.
